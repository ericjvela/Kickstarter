#Kickstarter Data

##Columns Explanation
1) ID = internal kickstarter id
2) name = name of project - A project is a finite work with a clear goal that youâ€™d like to bring to life. Think albums, books, or films.
3) category = category
4) main_category = category of campaign
5) currency = currency used to support
6) deadline = deadline for crowdfunding
7) goal = fundraising goal - The funding goal is the amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project.
8) launched = launched date launched
9) pledged = amount pledged by "crowd"
10) state = Current condition the project is in
11) backers = number of backers
12) country = country pledged from
13) usd pledged = amount of money pledged

#Logistic Regression Models

##Using the training data to create a model

###Find summary statistics when the Kickstarter succeed (1) or did not (0)
```{r}
summaryBy(goal + pledged + backers + currency ~ binomState, data = KickTrain, fun = c(mean,sd))
```
It appears that Kickstarters that had less funding, less pledges, less currency, and less backers failed.


###Creating a glm model on the training data and summary
```{r}
glmmodTrain <- glm(binomState ~ goal + pledged + backers + DateDiffDays + currency, data = KickTrain, family = binomial)
summary(glmmodTrain)
```

###Find odds ratios
```{r}
exp(glmmodTrain$coefficients)
```


###Plotting the model
```{r}
plot(glmmodTrain)
```

###Creating probabilty of failure (1) or not (0)
```{r}
glmTrainProbs <- predict.glm(glmmodTrain, type = "response")
hist(glmTrainProbs)
```

```{r}
table(KickStar$binomState)

glmTrainPreds <- rep("Failed", nrow(KickTrain))
glmTrainPreds[glmTrainProbs > 0.5] <- "Succeed"
conftab <- table(glmTrainPreds, true = KickTrain$binomState)
print(conftab)
```

```{r}
TPtrain <- conftab[2, 2]/(conftab[1, 2] + conftab[2, 2])
TNtrain <- conftab[1, 1]/(conftab[1, 1] + conftab[2, 1])
FPtrain <- conftab[2, 1]/(conftab[2, 1] + conftab[1, 1])
FNtrain <- conftab[1, 2]/(conftab[1, 1] + conftab[2, 1])
```

##Using the TESTING data to create a model


###Find summary statistics when the Kickstarter failed (1) or did not fail (0)
```{r}
summaryBy(goal + pledged + backers + currency + DateDiffDays ~ binomState, data = KickTest, fun = c(mean,sd))
```
It appears that Kickstarters that had less funding, less pledges, less currency, and less backers failed.


###Creating a glm model on the training data and summary
```{r}
glmmodTest <- glm(binomState ~ goal + pledged + backers + DateDiffDays + currency, data = KickTest, family = binomial)
summary(glmmodTest)
```

###Find odds ratios
```{r}
exp(glmmodTest$coefficients)
```


###Plotting the model
```{r}
plot(glmmodTest)
```

###Creating probabilty of failure (1) or not (0)
```{r}
glmTestProbs <- predict.glm(glmmodTest, type = "response")
hist(glmTestProbs)
```

```{r}
glmTestPreds <- rep("Failed", nrow(KickTest))
glmTestPreds[glmTestProbs > 0.5] <- "Succeed"
conftabTest <- table(glmTestPreds, true = KickTest$binomState)
print(conftabTest)
```

```{r}
TPtest <- conftabTest[2, 2]/(conftabTest[1, 2] + conftabTest[2, 2])
TNtest <- conftabTest[1, 1]/(conftabTest[1, 1] + conftabTest[2, 1])
FPtest <- conftabTest[2, 1]/(conftabTest[2, 1] + conftabTest[1, 1])
FNtest <- conftabTest[1, 2]/(conftabTest[1, 1] + conftabTest[2, 1])

#TRAINING RESULTS 
print(TPtrain)
print(TNtrain)
print(FPtrain)
print(FNtrain)

#TESTING RESULTS
print(TPtest)
print(TNtest)
print(FPtest)
print(FNtest)
```

###Test vs Training MSE
```{r}
#Might not need to do this because "prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleadingprediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading"
predictKickTrainLogistic <- predict(glmmodTrain, newdata = KickTrain, type = "response")
KickTrainLogisticMSE = mean((KickTrain$binomState - predictKickTrainLogistic)^2)

predictKickTestLogistic <- predict(glmmodTest, newdata = KickTest, type = "response")
KickTestLogisticMSE = mean((KickTest$binomState - predictKickTestLogistic)^2)


print(KickTrainLogisticMSE)
print(KickTestLogisticMSE)
```


#Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net Models

```{r}
myFormula <- as.formula(binomState ~ main_category + currency + goal + pledged + backers + country + usd.pledged + DateDiffDays)

Xvar <- build.x(myFormula, KickTrain) 
Yvar <- build.y(myFormula, KickTrain)


LassoMod <- cv.glmnet(x = Xvar, y = Yvar, alpha = 1, nfolds = 10)
plot(LassoMod)

#Ridge Mod.
RidgeMod <- cv.glmnet(x = Xvar, y = Yvar, alpha = 0, nfolds = 10)
plot(RidgeMod)

#Elastic Net
ElasticNet1 <- cv.glmnet(x = Xvar, y = Yvar, alpha = .25, nfolds = 10)
ElasticNet2 <- cv.glmnet(x = Xvar, y = Yvar, alpha = .50, nfolds = 10)
ElasticNet3 <- cv.glmnet(x = Xvar, y = Yvar, alpha = .75, nfolds = 10)
plot(ElasticNet1)

#MSE
MSE <- function(true, preds) { mean((true - preds)^2) }
MSE(KickTrain$binomState, predict(LassoMod, newx = Xvar))
MSE(KickTrain$binomState, predict(RidgeMod, newx = Xvar))
MSE(KickTrain$binomState, predict(ElasticNet1, newx = Xvar))
MSE(KickTrain$binomState, predict(ElasticNet2, newx = Xvar))
MSE(KickTrain$binomState, predict(ElasticNet3, newx = Xvar))

```

###Tree Based Methods
```{r}
newKickStar <- subset(KickStar, select = -c(1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12,14,15))
trainSize <- .02
trainInd <- sample(1:nrow(newKickStar), size = floor(nrow(newKickStar) * trainSize))
newKickTrain <- newKickStar[trainInd, ]
newKickTest <- newKickStar[-trainInd, ]
```


```{r}
#README!!! make sure you click the green arrow to run this properly
#method = class for classification problem
tree <- rpart(state ~ .-binomState, data = newKickTrain, method = "class", control = rpart.control(minsplit=30,  cp=0.01))
par(xpd=TRUE)
print(tree)
plot(tree) 
text(tree, pretty = 0)
```

##Pruning Tree
```{r}
# HAVENT TOUCHED THIS YET 
# predict using the test data
tree.pred <- predict(tree.carseats,Carseats[-train,],type="class")
# note with() command evaluates an R expression in an environment 
# constructed from the data, 
with(Carseats[-train,],table(tree.pred,High))

require('ISLR')
require('tree')

# now do some cross-validating
cv.kick = cv.tree(tree,FUN=prune.misclass)
cv.carseats
plot(cv.carseats)
prune.carseats=prune.misclass(tree.carseats,best=13)
plot(prune.carseats);text(prune.carseats,pretty=0)

# now let's evaluate this pruned tree on the dataset
tree.pred = predict(prune.carseats, Carseats[-train,],type="class")
with(Carseats[-train,],table(tree.pred,High))
(72+32)/150

```




###WORK ON THIS LATER
```{r}
MSE <- function(truth, predict) {mean((truth - predict)^2)}
predsTrain <- predict(tree, newdata = newKickTrain)
predsValidate <- predict(tree, newdata = newKickTest)
MSE(newKickStar$binomState, predsTrain)
MSE(newKickStar$binomState, predsValidate)
```

###Random Forest

WEBSITE USED: https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cart.html

```{r}
randTree <- randomForest(state ~ ., data=newKickTrain, mtry=3, method = "class")
importance(randTree)
plot(randTree)
```
